/*
Your assignment is to take a large piece of JSON data and find different values for that data.


Use the https://pokeapi.co/ website.
You will see a "Try it now" section. Inside the text field it should have "pokemon/ditto/".
If you don't see data below the label "Resource for ditto", you will need to click the blue "submit" button.
At the bottom of the section where the data is presented there is a small checkbox labeled "View raw JSON". Check it.

Now take the data and paste it into your editor. Assign a variable name for it.

I recommend that you minify this before you put it into the console.

Now using the data that you have I want you to find the following values.

All the abilities
The base experience
The height
The url for the item "metal-powder"
All the sprites
The different stat names
The slot for the types
The weight
The first version_group_details
